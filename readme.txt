== Description ==


> “Incredible support and quick responses: I can’t say enough about the support that comes with this plugin! They truly went above and beyond to make the edits I requested and fix other little bugs.” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  [jewelsmac6](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incredible-support-and-quick-responses/)


Having a Wishlist is  essential for any eCommerce platform, offering both users and store owners a range of benefits. With our WooCommerce Wishlist plugin, users have the ability to:

* Save their favorite products effortlessly, enabling them to quickly find and purchase them later.
* Share their wishlists with friends and family for special occasions, introducing new potential customers to your store.
* Create & customize as many wishlists as they want, one for new year, one for their loved ones, and more.
* Promote their wishlist on social networks, acting as indirect marketing for your brand.

But the benefits aren't just for your users. As a store owner, you can:

* Enhance customer loyalty by providing a seamless shopping experience.
* Gain insights into current product trends by tracking items added to wishlists.
* Boost overall sales as customers often end up buying more than their initially planned items when they revisit their wishlists.
* Improve site visibility and attract new visitors through shared wishlists.

Similar to other plugins that offer the same functionality (like YITH, TI Wishlist & WPC Smart), this plugin is user-friendly, enabling your customers to streamline their shopping journey, reducing the time spent searching for products and adding them to the cart.

Whether you want to provide a platform for customers to bookmark their favorite items, offer a feature for post favorites, or create public and private wishlists, our WooCommerce Wishlist Plugin caters to all these needs and more.

Incorporating the wishlist feature can substantially increase sales and generate loyal customers.

So, if you're looking to elevate your WooCommerce store, this Wishlist plugin is the perfect solution.
